      <p>
        When I worked at <Link href="https://codete.com/">Codete</Link>, we used to play football
        every week. But not everyone could make it every time, so we used to
        use <Link href="https://doodle.com">Doodle</Link> to handle the enrollment.
        But it was not convenient enough.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were at least 2 guys not happy with it, so they decided to create an app just for that.
        The idea was simple: allow a user to mark their availability for the next game with a single click.
      </p>
      <p>
        Me & <Link href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michal-marciniec/">Micha≈Ç Marciniec</Link> have
        teamed up against the challenge. I did the the frontend, he did the backend. I heard through
        the grapevine that the app is still used at <Link href="https://codete.com/">Codete</Link> to this day.

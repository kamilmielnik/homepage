      <p>
        When I worked at Codete, we used to play football every week. But not everyone could
        make it every time, so we used to use <Link href="https://doodle.com">doodle.com</Link> to
        handle the enrollment. But it was not convenient enough.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were at least 2 guys not happy with it, so they decided to create an app just for that.
        The idea was simple: allow a user to mark their availability for the next game with a single click.
      </p>
      <p>
        Me & Micha≈Ç Marciniec have teamed up against the challenge. I did the the frontend, he did
        the backend. I heard through the grapevine that the app is still used at Codete to this day.
